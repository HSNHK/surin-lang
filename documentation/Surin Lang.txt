surin is an interpreter language written in golang or python
This means that its structure can be implemented in other languages.
There are a few basic concepts in the construction of interpretive programming languages that I will describe here.

(interpreters)

An article on language interpreters on Wikipedia

In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language,
without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;
Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this;
Explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.
Early versions of Lisp programming language and minicomputer and microcomputer BASIC dialects would be examples of the first type.
Perl, Python, MATLAB, and Ruby are examples of the second, while UCSD Pascal is an example of the third type.
Source programs are compiled ahead of time and stored as machine independent code,
which is then linked at run-time and executed by an interpreter and/or compiler (for JIT systems).
Some systems, such as Smalltalk and contemporary versions of BASIC and Java may also combine two and three.
Interpreters of various types have also been constructed for many languages traditionally associated with compilation,
such as Algol, Fortran, Cobol, C and C++.

While interpretation and compilation are the two main means by which programming languages are implemented,
they are not mutually exclusive, as most interpreting systems also perform some translation work, just like compilers.
The terms "interpreted language" or "compiled language" signify that the canonical implementation of that language is an interpreter or a compiler,
respectively. A high level language is ideally an abstraction independent of particular implementations.

In the above, you found that the interpreter is a program that receives the code as input and executes it directly,
and unlike compilers, the code is not translated into another language.


Description of language structure

The file extension is .sur
This means that the code must be stored in this file for interpretation.
The following command is used to interpret the file:

Command : surin filename.sur

And to open the interpreter directly, just run the executable file.
